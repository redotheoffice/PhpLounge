PhpLounge
=========

Php Lounge is another implementation of a PHP-CouchDb mapping. It's mainly developped to
create a nice array-like interface to a CouchDb. I thought this was lacking with the other
Php CouchDb projects.

This is just a small start, focussed on personal use. Feel free to contact me if you'd like
to improve the library!
